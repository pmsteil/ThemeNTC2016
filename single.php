               </div>
               <p>Many pastors dream of building a strong audience with young people. Rev. Dr. Greg Neal lives it every day.</p>
               <p>Dr. Neal, senior pastor of <a href="http://www.fumccommerce.org/" target="_blank" title="First UMC Commerce">First UMC Commerce</a>, is a social media rock star. He launched a show on the social media platform <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a> in May 2015, broadcasting six nights a week from his home in Commerce. His shows run 3-5 hours in length.</p>
               <p>Dr. Neal is a hit. Since May, he has an accumulated over 9 million views.</p>
               <p>“<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a> is interesting and very different,” he said. “It gets wild and woolly. The audience is very young, not churched — or if they are, they are on the edge of church. It is a great space to talk to people outside the church. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a> is an incredible tool that could be used by the church.”</p>

               <p>Over 60 percent of the audience is 13 to 25 years old.</p>

               </div>
               <h3>WHAT’S THE ATTRACTION?</h3>
               <p>But what is it about a 49-year-old pastor in an East Texas town that would draw the young? Especially considering that most of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a>’s broadcasters are 13 to 20.</p>
               <p>His best guess? “It's the fact that I don't take myself too seriously, that I like and play their kind of music, that I don't ever judge them for the things they've done wrong, and I'm patient with them. Many times they'll say things like ‘I wish you were my dad’ or ‘I wish my pastor was like you.’ “</p>
               <p>And it’s also his message. “Many of today’s young people have been told that they’re going to hell for everything from makeup and tattoos to piercings, their clothing, their music, or their sexual orientations; I felt called to share with them that God does not hate them, that God loves them, accepts them, and has made them to be who and what they are — beautiful, diverse, beloved children of God.”</p>
               <h3>HOW HE STARTED</h3>
               <div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 11px; width: 220px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/images/reality-potatoes-anya.png" alt="Reality Potatoes, a.k.a. Anya, drew Dr. Neal in Pictionary." style="width: 210px;"><br>
               <strong>Reality Potatoes, a.k.a. Anya, drew Dr. Neal in Pictionary.</strong>
               </div>
               <p>Neal found out about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a> a couple months before he jumped in with his own broadcasts after a young member of his church told him about it.</p>
               <p> “She told me how one of its broadcasters had kept her from committing suicide. I had been a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/revneal" target="_blank" title="YouTube">YouTuber</a> since 2006 but hadn’t heard of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a>. So out of curiosity, I joined in order to find out what it was all about. I was immediately impressed by the amazing group of broadcasters and fans that I found.</p>
               <p>“Unfortunately, I was also horrified by the many cruel words of bitter intolerance, condemnation and outright hatred being spewed in the name of God at broadcasters and those in their chats by those who claimed to be Christians,” Dr. Neal said. “I decided to start broadcasting in order to present a positive expression of the love of God for all.”</p>
               <p>His first broadcast was short and only three people came across it.</p>
               <p>“Each one accosted me for being on a site that was supposedly intended only for young people. It nearly discouraged me from trying to broadcast again,” he said.</p>
               <h3>LOYAL VIEWERS</h3>
               <div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; font-size: 11px; width: 250px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/images/greg-neal-tabitha.png" alt="Tabitha, Greg Neal’s cat, has endeared herself to the audience with her demands for attention." style="width: 240px;"><br>
               <strong>Tabitha, Greg Neal’s cat, has endeared herself to the audience with her demands for attention.</strong>
               <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/images/greg-neal-kitties.png" alt="The young followers like to doctor up photos playing on Tabitha." style="margin-top: 15px; width: 240px;"><br>
               <strong>The young followers like to doctor up photos playing on Tabitha.</strong>
               </div>
               <p>But as he built a following, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a> spotted a potential star that could also draw in an older — and more affluent — age range. That’s when it made him a partner, then an Editor’s Choice, meaning that when people went to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a>, the chances were good they’d be dropped into his broadcast.</p>
               <p> “Now I have listeners in Australia, Asia, Kuwait and Russia,” he said. “Listeners have told me that as a result of my show, they are going back to church or reconsidering their faith. Once a person who was a cutter told me that after listening to me they flushed their razors and started taking their meds.”</p>
               <p>In the format, viewers can see Dr. Neal as he broadcasts. From his side of the screen, he can see the list and numbers of watchers, and see the questions they type, which may include a profile picture of them by their name. Occasionally there is a split screen of the pastor and a questioner. Another time, his 79-year-old mother was a guest – and proved quite popular. The other regulars are his tabby, Tabitha – “the darling of the broadcast” – and his Basset hound Fannie, both wandering in and out of picture enough that loyal viewers ask about them if they go missing.</p>
               <h3>THE QUESTIONS</h3>
               <p>And the questions come fast and furiously. The most common, he said, is: “Do homosexuals go to hell? With the follow-up or adjunct statement being, ‘All Christian pastors say that gays will burn in hell, no matter what. Why do you say otherwise?’ ”</p>
               <p>Vanessa Paulin, a <a href="http://www.fumccommerce.org/" target="_blank" title="First UMC Commerce">First UMC Commerce</a> member and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tamuc.edu/" target="_blank" title="Texas A&amp;M-Commerce">Texas A&amp;M-Commerce</a> student, likes that she feels free “to ask whatever I want in regards to religion and occasionally other things. He answers all the questions that he gets asked whether related to religion or pop culture.”</p>
               <p>He’s “professional yet down to earth. Kind, but at the same time firm when he needs to be,” she said.</p>
               <p>And his following isn’t just the teens. David Finn, another <a href="http://www.fumccommerce.org/" target="_blank" title="First UMC Commerce">First UMC Commerce</a> member and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tamuc.edu/" target="_blank" title="Texas A&amp;M-Commerce">Texas A&amp;M-Commerce</a> student, calls him “accessible to older adults, younger adults, and youth.</p>
               <p>“He’s one of the easiest people to contact through any and all of these social media methods. He communicates well to people of all generations and educational levels,” Finn said.</p>
               <h3>TALK ABOUT CONNECTION</h3>
               <div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; font-size: 11px; width: 180px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/images/krayonix.png" alt="Krayonix showed his admiration for Dr. Neal." style="width: 170px;"><br>
               <strong>Krayonix showed his admiration for Dr. Neal.</strong>
               </div>
               <p>An almost nightly viewer, Finn feels “connected to my church, to Christians all over the world, and to God through Dr. Greg’s online ministry. And through my connections with Dr. Greg’s broadcast ministry, I've met so many people and good friends all over the world.</p>
               <p>“I may not be there for the entire four- or five-hour broadcast, but I'll watch and support him as much as I can.”</p>
               <p>And how is Dr. Neal able to devote so many hours to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.younow.com/DrGreg/channel" target="_blank" title="YouNow">YouNow</a>? It’s time the single pastor used to spend watching TV or playing on the computer. Now, even at four hours or more, the broadcasts seem to fly by.</p>
               <p>“I wish there were more clergy who would broadcast. I’d love to bring another clergy on my show to prove that I am not some anomaly,” Dr. Neal said. “People think that I am an unusual UMC pastor.”</p>
               <p>In Paulin’s words, “Dr. Neal is as real and transparent as a minister can get.”</p>
